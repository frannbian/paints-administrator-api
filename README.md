Paints administrator

## Features

- OAuth Security
- Docker
- Paints CRUD
- Cached responses

## Installation

Require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frannbian/extendeal-challange.git
cd extendeal-challange
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app /bin/bash (for Windows use docker-compose exec app //bin//bash)
composer install
php artisan telescope:install
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan passport:install
php artisan passport:client --client (save the credentials, we gonna user later)

```
After that the microservice will start at http//localhost:8070, you'll see a documentation & playground as a home.

¿How to play with the endpoints?
First we need to get an access_token from the auth endpoint, we need to set the client_id and client_secret (I told you we gonna use it :P).
After we get the token we'll be able to user all the others endpoint, always setting the token header and for the Paint endpoint we also have to set the X-HTTP-USER-ID header.

Example for filters & fields in GET Paint Endpoint:
http://localhost:8070/api/v1/paints?filters[country]=URU&fields[1]=id&fields[2]=name&fields[3]=painter

## Request & Responses 
For logs of the request & responses we gonna use "Laravel Telescope" a powerfull package for this feature.
¿How to use? Easy. Just go to http://localhost:8070/telescope;
